# U2.W4: Separate Numbers with Commas

## Learning Competencies
- Break down problems into implementable pseudocode
- Iterate through data structures and manipulate the content
- Use if/else statements, string methods, while/until loops, Enumerable#each methods
- Use strings, integers, arrays, and/or hashes

## Summary
Write a method `separate_comma` which takes an integer as its input and returns a comma-separated integer as a string.  Like this:

```ruby
separate_comma(1000)    # => "1,000"
separate_comma(1000000) # => "1,000,000"
separate_comma(0)       # => "0"
separate_comma(100)     # => "100"
```

*NOTE: Even if you are comfortable with regular expressions, do not use them in this challenge, it's all about the logic!*

You have some rspec for this. It's saved in your `my_solutions` directory. If you can think of any cases the RSpec doesn't cover, see if you can write tests using Driver Test Code that test the missing case.
