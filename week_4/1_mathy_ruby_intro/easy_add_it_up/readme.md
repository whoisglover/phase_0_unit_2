# U2.W4: Add it up!


## Learning Competencies
- Use Tests to guide development
- Break down problems into implementable pseudocode
- Iterate through data structures and manipulate the content
- Find and use built-in Ruby methods to solve challenges
- Use if/else statements, string methods, while/until loops, Enumerable#each methods


## Summary
Write a method `total` which takes an `Array` of numbers as its input and returns their total (sum).

For example,

```ruby
total([1,2,3])      # => 6
total([4.5, 0, -1]) # => 3.5
total([-100, 100])  # => 0
```

Then, write another method `sentence_maker` which takes an `Array` of strings or numbers and returns 
each element joined into a sentence. 
*Note: The first letter should be capitalized and the sentence should end with a period.*

```ruby
sentence_maker(["i", "want", "to", "go", "to", "the", "movies"]) 
# => "I want to go to the movies."
```

**Commit your changes after each release (except for Release 0)!**

## Release 0:. Run the tests
In your terminal, make sure you are in the [easy_add_it_up](./) directory. Type `rspec` followed by the spec file name. ex. `rspec array_total_spec.rb`
Each test should fail. Read the output in your terminal to see what is making the tests fail.
