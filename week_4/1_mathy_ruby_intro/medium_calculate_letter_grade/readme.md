# U2.W4: Calculate a Letter Grade

## Learning Competencies
- Use tests to guide development
- Break down problems into implementable pseudocode 
- Find and use built-in Ruby methods to solve challenges
-  Use if/else statements, string methods, while/until loops, Enumerable#each methods


## Summary:
Create a method `get_grade` that accepts an `Array` of test scores.  Each score in the array should be between `0` and `100`, where
`100` is the max score.

Compute the average score and return the letter grade as a `String`, i.e., `'A'`, `'B'`, `'C'`, `'D'`, `'E'`, or `'F'`.

For example,

```ruby
# How studious!
get_grade([100, 100, 100]) # => 'A'
```

## Release 0:. Run the tests
In your terminal, make sure you are in the [medium_calculate_letter_grade](./) directory. Type `rspec` followed by the spec file name. ex. `rspec letter_grade_spec.rb`
Each test should fail. Read the output in your terminal to see what is making the tests fail.
