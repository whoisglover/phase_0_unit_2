# U2.W4: Calculate the Median


## Learning Competencies
- Use tests to guide development
- Break down problems into implementable pseudocode 
- Use strings, integers, arrays, and/or hashes
- Use if/else statements, string methods, while/until loops, Enumerable#each methods


## Summary:

Write a method `median` which takes an `Array` of numbers as its input and returns the median value.

You might want to look up the definition of "median."

For example,

```ruby
median([1,2,3])      # => 2
median([4.5, 0, -1]) # => 0
median([-100, 100])  # => 0.0
```

Once you get the `Array` of numbers passing the tests, try to find the median of an array of strings. 
In this case, your method should return the word most in between the other words. 

```ruby
median(["apple","cherry","banana"])      # => "banana"
```

## Release 0:. Run the tests
In your terminal, make sure you are in the [harder_calculate_median](./) directory. Type `rspec` followed by the spec file name. ex. `rspec median_spec.rb`
Each test should fail. Read the output in your terminal to see what is making the tests fail.
