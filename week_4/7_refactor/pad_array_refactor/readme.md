# U2.W4: Review, Refactor: Pad an Array

## Learning Competencies
- Identify and explain what code is doing
- Implement new ways to solve a problem

## Summary
Here's your opportunity to deepen your understanding of coding principles. In this challenge, you'll review some of your cohort members solutions and then modify your solution to implement new tricks. 

## Release 0: Review Others
Find two solutions to the pad an array exercise you found particularly enlightening. Give them feedback on their solution. Tell them what you liked about it. 
Copy their code into your `my_solution.rb` file and run the rspec to make sure they work. (You will need to comment out all solutions except the one you are testing)
**Commit your changes.**

## Release 1: Refactor Yours
Copy your initial solution into the my_solution](my_solution.rb) file. Then, in the "refactored solution" section, re-write your solution using the new tricks you learned. 
**Make inline comments explaining your additions!** (How does this code work?  Why did you add it? What makes it better code?)  
**Commit your changes.**

## Release 2: Test your new solution
Comment out all other solutions in your file and run the spec file. Your code should pass all of the tests. 
**Commit your changes.**

## Release 3: [Reflect]((../../../references/reflection_guidelines.md))
Reflect on your learning in the [my_solution](my_solution.rb) file. 
***NOTE: Reflections are mandatory!*** 

## Release 4: Sync your repo with GitHub
When you feel confident with your solution, sync your changes through the GitHub desktop app with your repo on GitHub. 
If you have done this successfully, you should be able to see your new code on your repo on [github.com](https://github.com).
