## Release 1: Research

Claude M. Steele has spent his life researching minority underachievement and developed a theory called "Stereotype Threat." Conduct your own research about stereotype threat. Identify times when you felt it. How did it affect your achievement? What questions did you ask yourself? Did you feel it physically?

## Release 2: Blog it!

In your post, describe your experiences with stereotype threat and how it affected you. Then identify what you plan to do when you feel stereotype threat or suspect someone else is feeling it. How will you create meaningful feedback or ask for feedback? How will you work to change the environment you're in to make it more welcoming? How will you address it in public?

Go into as much depth feels comfortable for you. 

##Text for this blog:

As a college aged white male I honestly haven't had a lot of experience with the concept of Stereotype Threat.  I have taken quite a bit of upper level math courses and I suppose I may have felt that my asian classmates were outperforming me.  I don't remember feeling very strongly about this and I can't say with certainty if it affected my performance.  Since I am in a position to not be as at risk with stereotype threatening as others, I would like to become good at disrupting it.  By this I mean I want anyone I work with to feel confident in their abilities and not feel any judgement from me due to stereotypes, or due to anything for that matter.  I plan on accomplishing this by continually improving my mindfulness and actively remind myself to be open and accepting to anyone.  I also plan on dishing out plenty of compliments to coworkers that are performing well, my nightmare would be to be the guy that gets jealous when my peers are succeeding.
