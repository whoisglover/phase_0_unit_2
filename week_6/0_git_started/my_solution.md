## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add

Files need to be added to the 'staging area' before you can commit/upload the changes you decide to make to them.  Git add filename performs this staging operation.  Git add -a adds all the untracked files in the directory.

#### branch
A branch is a copy of the entire code that can be modified without having an effect on the current status of the code.
This is perfect for development since you can branch the code, make changes, and if it breaks the code you haven't broken
the main code you had working originally and if it works you can merge back to the original code and add your changes.
The main code is held on a 'master' branch and that master branch can be branched.

#### checkout
git checkout is a command to switch between branches.  It is used by typing git checkout branchname (branchname being the name of the branch you wish to switch to)
<!-- Your defnition here -->

#### clone
Cloning completely copies a repository (your code) in a new location.  This is used so multiple people can get the code on their computer and work at the same time.  Cloning is used by typing git clone [url] (url being the url of the git repository)

#### commit
Git saves the changes you have made to the code.  It doesnt add them into the main code if you are working on a remote repository.

#### fetch
Fetch updates your local repository with any changes that have been made to the remote repo yours is based upon.
<!-- Your defnition here -->

#### log
Log shows all of the commits that have been made so far.  this includes author, date, conflicts, and corresponding merge message.
<!-- Your defnition here -->

#### merge
Merge combines two branches.  It is used when you are satisfied with the work you have completed on a branch and want to put it back into the main code.
<!-- Your defnition here -->

#### pull
Pull is a combination of fetch followed by merge.  This gets any new data from the remote repo you are using and automagically merges it into the branch that you are working in.
