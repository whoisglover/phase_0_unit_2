# U2.W6: Testing Assert Statements

# I worked on this challenge with:
# person1: Bridgette Salcido
# person2: Danny Glover 


# 2. Review the simple assert statement

def assert
  raise "Assertion failed!" unless yield
end

name = "bettysue"
assert { name == "bettysue" }
#assert { name == "billybob" }

# 2. Pseudocode what happens when the code above runs

# 1. We'll create a method (can be named anything, example: #check_card_verify) and 
# 2. The method will contain a custom error message following the keyword "raise" 
# 3. If the tests present in the {} do not evaluate to true (or if nothing is inside of the {}) the error message will be returned
# 4. If the tests present in the {} do evaluate to true, nothing is done
# 5. The assert method above returns an error message unless all tests evaluate to true
# 6. name != "billybob" so, the "assertion failed!" message is returned 



# The assert method is testing to see if the test is true. If the test is 
# true, nothing will happen. If the test is false, it will raise a fail 
# message. A fail message results from the code above because name does not 
# equal "billybob"


# 3. Copy your selected challenge here
class CreditCard
  def initialize(credit_card_number) 
    raise ArgumentError.new("Invalid Credit Card Number.") if credit_card_number.to_s.length != 16
    @credit_card_number = credit_card_number.to_s.split("")
  end
  

  def check_card
    verifiable_card_num = []
  
    @credit_card_number.each_with_index { |item,index| 
      if index % 2 != 0
        verifiable_card_num << item.to_i
      elsif index % 2 == 0 
        verifiable_card_num << (item.to_i * 2) 
      end }
 
    check_card_num = verifiable_card_num.to_s.split("")
  
    check_card_num.map!{|x| x.to_i}.inject(:+)
 
    return true if check_card_num.reduce(:+) % 10 == 0 
    return false if check_card_num.reduce(:+) % 10 !=0
  end  
end


# 4. Convert your driver test code from that challenge into Assert Statements

# 5. Reflection
=begin
* What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?    
Our strategy was to Pseudocode and then code while testing often.  Testing often and playing with irb as we went along cleared up any questions we had
as well as letting us know what functionalities are available such as custom names for assert statements.
* What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
We had some questions about creating custom names and messages for assert statements but we cleared them up by simply testing what we thought would work.
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
I'm not having trouble with any of the concepts at this point, this challenge seemed fairly straight forward and Bridgette was a great help.
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
I learned how to create custom error messages for assert statements.  I think error checking in code is extremely important and I'm excited to use my new knowledge
to develop code with strong error checking.
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies? 
I feel very confident with the Learning Competencies.  I am in a bit of a time crunch with finals right now but other than that I feel good about where I'm at with DBC.
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
I enjoyed pairing with Bridgette, she seems very interesting and easy to work with.  I think its going to be really fun to start meeting all my cohort mates
in person and start pairing in person.
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I didn't find this challenge tedious at all.
