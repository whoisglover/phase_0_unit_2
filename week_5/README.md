# Week 5: Ruby Classes

This week you will be working on creating ruby classes and translating RSpec into driver code. Please make sure to follow each step we ask you to do (write driver test code, pseudocode, initial solution, refactoring, reflection, and review). This week gets into more advanced concepts, so make sure you pair as often as you need to ensure you are able to learn efficiently and have fun doing it! You can pair on any challenge (except for solo challenges) and you have an awesome community of programmers to pair with. You can always ask people to pair on the community and work with people from other locations!

## Working through the challenges
Once you have the entire local repository on your computer, you don't need to read the challenges on github anymore (although we admit, it's prettier). You can open the entire repository in sublime and read the challenges in their original markdown. It will also help you find any link issues, since you can see where they are pointing. If you do find broken links, please let us by posting on the community, but also try to figure out a fix. It will help your markdown skills!


## Submitting your work

**You need to submit your work through on [apply.devbootcamp.com](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) by Sunday at 11:59pm. When you log in, look at your profile page. There should be a "Unit 2 Week 5 Submission" form.** 

## Remember your Unit Goals!
- Pair at least once this week with a member of your accountability group.  *You need to pair **4** times this unit*
- Give feedback for each person you paired with. *You need to submit at least 5 pieces of feedback in this unit* (4 for peer-pairing, and 1 GPS)
- Rate at least 7 pieces of [Meta Feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback) on Socrates. *You need to rate 20 pieces of feedback per unit.
